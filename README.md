These are the things that the team did wrong:
1) When Bob and Carol finished the feature and made a PR, Ted and Alice merged it but Bob didn't.
2) When Bob and Carol switched to Bob's laptop, Bob did not git pull origin master before he started working in a new branch.
3) When Ted & Alice and Bob & Carol both finished their work on the same time, they did not git pull origin master before they git push their new branches.
4) When resolving merge conflicts, only one person should do this to prevent additional merge conflicts.
5) After they resolved the first conflict, they both worked on master branch and this created another conflict.
6) When they finished their work, they did not git pull origin master before they did A-C-P.
